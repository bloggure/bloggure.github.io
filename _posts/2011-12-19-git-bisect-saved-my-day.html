<p>This morning one of the Jenkins job went red, 5 tests were failing, and it was very difficult to find out which commit caused the break (69 commits were concerned), I used git bisect to run maven tests to find the guilty one. Here is a quick howto:
<ul>
	<li>find a stable commit (in my case it was <strong>2ea34cf09cc83804cdcc445476bfb597c617a034</strong>)</li>
	<li>write a short script (myScript.sh) allowing you to run the tests:</li>
</ul>
</p>
{% highlight bash%}
#!/bin/sh
mvn -f path/to/my/pom.xml -Dtest=MyTestClass test
{% endhighlight %}
<ul>
	<li>git bisect start <strong>HEAD</strong> <strong>2ea34cf09cc83804cdcc445476bfb597c617a034</strong></li>
	<li>git bisect run ./myScript.sh</li>
</ul>
<p>
That's all, in a few runs (6 in my cases), git found out the commit causing the test failure, a simple git revert and tests were back to green !</p>
