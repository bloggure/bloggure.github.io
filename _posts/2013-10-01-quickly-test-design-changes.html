  When you're developping Web applications, you often ask yourself what does your beautiful design will look like if your users enter a very long text. Or you may want to prototype a new screen based on an existing one, I came around a quick hack using HTML5 goodness: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_Editable">content editable</a> !
</p>
<p>
  On the page you want to edit, open your JavaScript console (Cmd+Alt+I on Chrome Mac), and enter the following 
  {% highlight javascript %}
  document.body.contentEditable = true;
  {% endhighlight %}<br/>
  Now you can freely edit the text on your page, once you're done, you can switch off the content editable mode setting the property to false !
