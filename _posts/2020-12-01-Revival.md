# It's been a long time

It's been a very long time since last post (5 years...).

I am convinced that blogging is useful, at least for my present self, and for my future self that tends to lose track of important things.

## What will this be about ?

In the _past_ I blogged a lot about Java / Maven and so on, my days have evolved to another languages, so I guess
there will be less JVM things (but may be a few Kotlin) and more Swift / Rust on the other end.

## Technical stack

In a blog reboot, we (I mean dev) like to follow the latest trend and migrate our blog system to latest hype stack.
I will avoid this and focus on writing instead, so the site stays in its 15' shape:
 
 * [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
 * [github-pages](https://pages.github.com)
 * markdown (I think `jenkins-asciidoc` is around the corner though)
 * [github actions](https://actions.github.com) for building

The sole new thing is that I'm trying to write using [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io) to get a distraction free environment.
