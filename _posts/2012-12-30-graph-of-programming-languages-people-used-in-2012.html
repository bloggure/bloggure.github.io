<p>I came across this link representing a visualization of programming languages usage based on a hashtag collect : <a href="http://www.ioncannon.net/projects/code2012/">http://www.ioncannon.net/projects/code2012/</a></p> <p>Although this method can be criticized, it provides interesting data : JavaScript is the clear winner with Java just behind. We can see Scala is a growing language too, it has been used more than PHP last year (according to this study). </p>
