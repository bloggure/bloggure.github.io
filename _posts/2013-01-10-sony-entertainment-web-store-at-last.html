<p>I own a Playstation3 since January 2009 after getting the famous RROD on two successives Xbox 360. The PS3 is a really a nice gaming device, but the guys at Sony have  another focusing on everything but their store experience to their end users.</p>

<p>When I left the Xbox 360 world, one of the best feature of it was its store, I could even access it from my web browser and launch downloads so that I can play my games when I got home. I seriously miss this feature on the PS3. But I found that Sony, I guess along with the big store rewrite they made a few weeks ago, now allows us to browse and buy easily from our browser : <a style="text-align: center;" href="https://store.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com">https://store.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com</a>.</p>

<em><del datetime="2013-01-23T07:11:44+00:00">I don't know yet if the download will be automagically launched when my Playstation 3 will automatically wake up to synchronise my Playstation+ account.<br/>I'll update this post when I'll know !</del><br/>
It seems that the downloads don't get pushed automatically to the console nor are downloaded when the console is syncing. Come on Sony, you've come so close !</em>
