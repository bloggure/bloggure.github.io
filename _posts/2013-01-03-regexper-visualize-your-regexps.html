There is a famous quote about regular expressions, to which I don't really agree but I have to admit there is not much love for regexps around me. 
<blockquote>
Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems.

I came across this little tool : <a href="http://www.regexper.com/">Regexper</a> allowing to easily understand a regular expression by providing its state machine diagram :

I think it could be useful to put it in your bookmarks with <a href="http://rejex.heroku.com/">Rejex</a> to use it when you work with regular expressions.
