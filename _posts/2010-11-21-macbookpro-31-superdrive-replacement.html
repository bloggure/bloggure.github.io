<!--:en--><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-144" title="MBP 3.1" src="http://www.bloggure.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/MBP-3.1.png" alt="" width="150" height="53" /><p>I am owner of a not so old MacbookPro (3.1 - late 2007), and, as it is my main development machine, I felt a little lack of space and speed mainly because of its hard drive (5400rpm / 160GB).</p>

<p>I wanted speed and so I got a new generation drive with a 120GB SSD, I wanted space so I have dumped the useless SuperDrive from my machine to replace it with a drive caddy (found <a title="here" href="http://newmodeus.com/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=258" target="_blank">here</a>) where I have put my old HDD.</p>

<p>The operation is not so easy, but if you are careful and if you take your time, you will not regret what you'll get !</p>

<p>My machine is now blazing fast and it helped me keeping it more instead of buying a shiny new MBP with an unremoveable battery (I think I don't have the feeling with laptop batteries...)</p>
